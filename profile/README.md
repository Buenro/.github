# Welcome to Buenro on GitHub üöÄ

Hello! We are Buenro, a startup pioneering a platform for a vibrant community of digital nomads, entrepreneurs, community leaders, innovators, and travelers. Our mission extends beyond traditional living paradigms, by weaving genuine connections in both digital realms and physical settings. Through this, we aim to alleviate loneliness and empower individuals to thrive in their chosen locales, thus fostering a thriving ecosystem where creativity, leadership, and innovation are nurtured. Our platform is crafted with an underlying ethos of belonging, embodying values that resonate with love, trust, gratitude, contribution, joy, and courage, making Buenro more than just a platform, but a home where everyone truly belongs.


## Remote First, Community at Heart üíªüíñ

At Buenro, we thrive as a fully remote company, embracing asynchronous operations. Our digital interactions are robust, yet the allure of in-person connections brings us together during team retreats at our base in Ibiza. This unique space doubles as a lab, where we fine-tune co-living experiences to ensure our platform resonates with the real-world needs of our community. Our team's global footprint extends to Bali and is soon branching into Europe and Asia, as we co-locate and build our own community. This evolving camaraderie is our take on a traditional office, encapsulating our longing for community while navigating the digital frontier.

## Digital Lease & Social Platform üè°üåê

Led by our founder Paula, Buenro is on a mission to craft a digital lease and social platform with a unique aim to combat loneliness. We believe everyone belongs somewhere, and with the aid of technology, we aspire to connect individuals with the communities where they'll thrive. Our platform is designed as a conduit for individuals to discover, share, and relish in co-living spaces and experiences in general, while forging meaningful connections that transform houses into homes. Through Buenro, we're creating a world where finding your tribe and establishing genuine connections is just a click away, ensuring everyone finds their place no matter where life takes them.
