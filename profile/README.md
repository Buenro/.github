# Welcome to Buenro on GitHub üöÄ

Hello! We are Buenro, a community crafted for digital nomads, by digital nomads. Our mission is to advance the future of living by fostering genuine connections in both digital and physical spaces, combating loneliness, and empowering individuals to live and work from their dream locations.

## Remote First, Community at Heart üíªüíñ

At Buenro, we embrace a remote-first culture spread across 8 different timezones, working asynchronously to take collaboration to the next level. We believe in a culture of ownership where everyone has a stake in what they create. Our co-living headquarters in Ibiza serves as a hub for our team to immerse in the Buenro culture, offering a beautiful co-living resort with amenities that make work feel like a vacation.

## Digital Lease & Social Platform üè°üåê

Guided by the vision of our founder Paula, Buenro is crafting a digital lease and social platform designed to encapsulate the essence of home, regardless of one's location. We are harnessing the power of technology to foster real-life connections, facilitating deeper interpersonal engagements. Our platform paves the way for individuals to choose, share, and flourish in co-living environments, transforming each house into a home through a global lifestyle enriched by a sense of community.
